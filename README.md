Important
---------

**Test it tough!** And test it on the stage of your final environment.

The backup files are encrypted. If you lose the keyfile, your backup is worthless.


Installation
------------

```
composer require webexcess/neos-backup
```

Commands
--------

Since this package only is a graphical implementation of WebExcess.Flow.Backup,
please have a look on the base backage too:
